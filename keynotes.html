His lab designs, develops and applies novel and robust data-driven, computational approaches that will accelerate the diffusion of genomics and biomedical data into translational research and education. His lab believes in data analysis transparency, effective sharing, reproducibility, software usability, and archival stability to foster a sustainable data science ecosystem in biomedical research. He holds a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from Georgia State University. Dr. Mangul obtained B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from Moldova State University, Chisinau, Moldova. He completed postdoctoral training with Prof. Eleazar Eskin in computational genomics at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER award.</p><div class="keynotes_keynoteContainer__D6_C4"><img src="victoria-popic.png"/><div class="keynotes_keynoteWrapper__Hyowz"><h3>Victoria Popic</h3><span>Broad Institute, USA</span></div></div><p>Dr. Victoria Popic is a Principal Investigator and Schmidt Fellow at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. She designs algorithms for genome analysis and interpretation, with a focus on efficiency, scalability, and privacy. Her work leverages techniques from artificial intelligence (in particular, computer vision and deep reinforcement learning), sketching algorithms, and combinatorics to address problems such as structural variation discovery and clonal evolution in cancer, genome phasing, and assembly. Victoria earned her Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University. She also holds a B.S. in computer science, a B.S. in mathematics, and an M.Eng. in computer science from MIT. </p><div class="keynotes_keynoteContainer__D6_C4"><img src="alex-zelikovsky.jpg"/><div class="keynotes_keynoteWrapper__Hyowz"><h3>Alex Zelikovsky</h3><span>Georgia State University, USA</span></div></div><p>Dr. Alex Zelikovsky is a Distinguished University Professor at the Department of Computer Science at Georgia State University, USA.

Dr. Oleksyk research interests are in evolution, comparative genomics, environmental toxicology, and genetic epidemiology. His background is in genomics, specifically as it relates to adaptation, speciation and disease. His scientific interests are in two general areas. The first is in genomics and admixture of human populations. His lab is involved in several studies focusing on human population genetics and the analysis of the candidate disease genes in the Caribbean and Eastern Europe. His other interest is in evolution and conservation of endangered species in the Caribbean. Dr. Oleksyk is involved in studies focusing on genome assembly and analysis; selection scans (Amazon parrots, Hispaniolan solenodons, African cheetah and elephants). Generally, he is interested in the study of genome diversity and its implications to evolutionary processes of adaptation and speciation.
