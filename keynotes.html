<h3>Victoria Popic</h3>
Broad Institute, USA</div>
</div>
<p>Dr. Victoria Popic is a Principal Investigator and Schmidt Fellow at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. She designs algorithms for genome analysis and interpretation, with a focus on efficiency, scalability, and privacy. Her work leverages techniques from artificial intelligence (in particular, computer vision and deep reinforcement learning), sketching algorithms, and combinatorics to address problems such as structural variation discovery and clonal evolution in cancer, genome phasing, and assembly. Victoria earned her Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University. She also holds a B.S. in computer science, a B.S. in mathematics, and an M.Eng. in computer science from MIT.</p>
