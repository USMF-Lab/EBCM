<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Bioinformatics is an applied interdisciplinary field whose primary purpose is to develop and deploy computational techniques to store, organize, and aid in the analysis and interpretation of large-scale data obtained from biological systems. While rooted in the analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences, it now encompasses techniques targeting multiple data acquisition modalities and seeks to comprehend the functioning of biological systems at many different levels. Bioinformaticians need to be cognizant of diverse scientific fields: basic and molecular biology, medecine, genomics, computational sciences, statistics, and computational medicine, thus requiring a thoroughly interdisciplinary set of skills to successfully apply bioinformatics methods on large scale biomedical datasets.

 Despite the growing importance of bioinformatics and computational medicine in enabling modern computational data-driven biomedical research, Moldova has not yet developed or established bioinformatics programs and core facilities in the academic institutions. To fill this gap, the body formed by the <strong>Technical University of Moldova (TUM)</strong>, the <strong>Nicolae Testemitanu State University of Medicine and Pharmacy (SUMP)</strong>, and <strong> the Moldova State University (MSU)</strong> in collaboration with<strong> Mangul Lab at University of Southern California School of Pharmacy (Los Angeles, USA)</strong>, with funding support from United States Agency for International Development (USAID), proposes the creation of an Eastern European bioinformatics knowledge hub to develop and promote bioinformatics knowledge and skills in the field of computational medicine and biomedical data science.

We propose to create a bioinformatics school through which we will provide an introduction to the use of bioinformatics approaches in biomedical research, giving participants guidance for using bioinformatics in their work. We also will provide hands-on training in tools and resources appropriate to their research.Participants will initially be introduced to bioinformatics theory and practice, including best practices for undertaking bioinformatics analysis, data management, version control  systems and reproducibility. 
The objective of this course is to train students in the state of the art bioinformatics tools and methods for rigorous, and reproducible biomedical data analysis, including methods to visualize display data and perform appropriate statistical analysis.  Students are expected to learn how to: 
</p>
<div class="styles_topics__Ojg5z">
<ul>
<li>Analyze the large-scale biomedical data using commonly used interactive python-based libraries and packages</li>
<li>Use various visualizations techniques to display real-world biomedical data in real-time   </li>
<li>Select the most appropriate statistical methods and apply it to real word biomedical data</li>
<li>Use version control and public repositories for transparent and reproducible data analysis</li>
<li>Write the data analysis component of a scientific manuscript and create an easy-to-navigate repository with the analysis accompanying the scientific manuscript </li>
<li>Prepare the “Code availability” and “Data availability” statement to make materials, data, code, and associated protocols promptly available to readers  as is required by a large number of scientific journals (e.g. Nature journals)</li>
<li>Run bioinformatics tools on the High Performance Cluster </li>
<li>Be able to participate in real scientific project and contribute with data analysis and interpretation </li>
